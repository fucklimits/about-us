I had trouble finding a resource for people studying for their INFOSEC certifications (that was kept updated) and for after they got into the real world.

This is why I created https://fucklimits.me 

This reasoning behind the domain is, because the of INFOSEC is always pushing yourself and the ones your protecting against to the limit!

If you don't understand that much, your in the wrong field ;)

I hope you enjoy my site, it will be a contstant work in progress. 
This github https://github.com/fucklimits?tab=repositories this is a list of repos I found useful, I hope so do you.
